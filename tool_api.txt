Tool API
========

Tools are added to the "tools" variable. The required fields are:

    # name - name of the tool
    # src  - path to JavaScript source file
    # icon - path to icon file (preferably SVG)

Each tool requires a JavaScript file to define the functionality of the tool. The functions that will be called are:

    # selected(div) - called when the tool is selected in the toolbox
    # deselected(div) - called when the tool is deselected in the toolbox (another tool is selected)
    # mousedown(event) - called on mouse down in the canvas
    # mousemove(event) - called on mouse move in the canvas
    # mouseup(event) - called on mouse up in the canvas
